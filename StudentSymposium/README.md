# Student Experiences
## Gabriel Chandler
My time at the symposium went all right, I was there from 12-2 and only presented to 4 people. It seemed like most people were there to look at specific posters, so I didn't get a lot of chances to talk to people walking by since they didn't show much interest. The three judges I presented to seemed interested and didn't offer any criticism about the subject and that it was quite cool to see the effect our project had on the client's work process.
