## Tech Stack Decisions:

### Ruby on Rails
- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- We will use Ruby on Rails because we are going to be building onto the clients' already existing code base, which is primarliy Ruby on Rails
### HTML and CSS
- The client does not use any frameworks or libraries like react; they use plain HTML and CSS, so, we will be using that as well for any front end elements. 
### AWS 
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- The details of this are not clear yet, however we know the client uses AWS and may need to use it for secure data storage
