## topics discussed
* Iteration 1 presented to William, he really liked how far we have gotten and how we managed to make the project work with some of their things being in a mediocre state. He says that this iteration already will save lots of time.
* Documentation liked our documentation and said that it seemed pretty straight forward from what he knows about the program.
* Iteration 2 features Quickbooks will happen late and docusign will come last. This next iteration we will make it more modular and work better for the end goal of customers filling out their information on their own. William signed off on this idea of making it self served next.
## Things clarified
* William said that quickbooks may be easier to integrate since quickbooks has more documentation.
* Iteration 2 will focus on making the program self served
