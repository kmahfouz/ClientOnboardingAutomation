## topics discussed
* Iteration 2
* Iteration 3 Features
## Things clarified
* Iteration 3 features will be getting quickbooks integrated and working
* William really appreciates what all we have gotten done and still believes that if we were to "cut funding" this would still be funcitonal enough to still use. It would cut down his work and still help and that we are moving in the direction we need to be.
* Likes the ideas we have for iteration 3
* May have a product team come work locally that we can use.
