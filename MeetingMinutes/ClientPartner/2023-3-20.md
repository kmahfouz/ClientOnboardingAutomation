## topics discussed
* Iteration 4
* Iteration 5 Features
## Things clarified
* If we ever need a follow up and he has not responded then text him
* On next iteration we will separate when everything happens so it better mocks how the client receives the emails and invites
* When asked about if there is anything else to add he said that everything he wanted is implemented, but he will ask another coworker, Jeff, if there is anything else that needs to be added/automated
## Client use of the project
* He used it by remoting through Zoom
* Creating the provider and users and saw how a contract is automatically made and sent to customer
* 10 minutes
* He said "I am not easily impressed and I am very impressed with this. I did not expect it to look this good." He said he was speechless.
* Separate how emails are sent so the process is more streamlined and in order
* Fix email issue with the new credentials William will provide
