## Topics Discussed

Finished Project: Sign contract, get account setup, begin using services without any employees help.
Will get separate account for us here soon.
Current Process: Do demo, send out contract VIA docusign, then William or Jeff have to go in and have to make their account manually.
Wants to make it so that it is completely self served.
Ruby on rails for current tech stack, backend
Hosting on AWS
Host website: live.yourdocumentor.com
Gave William emails to get access to repository
Will not get full access to the transmission part of the process just to make sure only clients are taking up that part of the process
All tied to marketing site, but also touch live site and admin panel
Will touch live in order to create account
Frontend: React on earlier version, Will says maybe all ruby on rails, Jeff will ask someone to clarify
Make sure it works on web for both computer and mobile

Steps for the user to sign up:
Find them through one of the ways they can be found, navigate through to the lets connect form, set up demo (usually contact will, wants to remove that process), display the contract information, will then manually sends out the contract depending on the price point, then creates account in the admin panel, *some panels won't load due to overload issues* new provider, add name and fill in sheet, create provider, this creates a login for Will and Jeff that allows them to access it and login, then W&J can use their login to create the client's credentials, create the first account from the company name tab and fill in the information, set them up as an admin (Should also be automated), select accept and fill out the rest of the information, they have to manually tell them they need their last 4 of social

*Manager role is a little broken*

There is a support account inside of their account, 

*recording for this process ^^^ *

After the client clicks on submit then W&J get an email with their information and they either have to call or email them and schedule a demo or just immediately sell it to them. 

Once the Client decides they want it, then they sign all of their documents, W&J send them the invoice, and then after receiving the payment they begin the account creating process.

Automate the payment process as well, make it so that they don't need to send them the invoice

Automate the first email that W&J send that is the demo time, potential options: talk to us, virtual demo, buy now

Must get some real information from the client so that they only show it to people who are willing to buy it, not just their competitors

Making the product to the client simple is a high priority, that is their main sales pitch, be as simple and main streamed as possible, the least amount of clicks and thinking possible

Get waivers from the state of IN to get someone to come out and help you, clock in and clock out service for these waiver companies since IN forces them to digitially document this information now

Add in the clients, services provided for these client, clock in for that specific client, this captures their location, they then clock out, but must add a note first, then the manager can approve their visits

Information we will have to store is through AWS

Are we pushing to their current codebase?
William will get back to exactly what and where we would be working depending on the place to be editing

## Things Clarified

Get access to all of the necessary repos and AWS
Get in contact with their development team
